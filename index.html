			<h1>Welcome</h1>
			<p>I'm Helen Plesko - born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I'm currently a GIS Applications Specialist student at Fleming College, where I've been creatively using Esri's technology and other GIS software to interpret aerial photography, prepare and edit geospatial datasets and databases, and create meaningful cartographic outputs. Continue scrolling or use the navigation buttons below to see the projects I've completed using Esri-focused products throughout my educational studies at Fleming College.</p>

								<p>This cartographic output summarizes the method and results of a statistical analysis of Primary Care Enrolment in Toronto, Ontario. The variables involved in the analysis were: employed population, university graduates with a certificate or diploma, median household income after tax, and primary care enrolment values. Data related to these variables were gathered through reliable open sourced hubs. ArcGIS Pro's Ordinary Least Squares and Geographically Weighted Regression tools were used to conduct and evaluate the analysis. </p>

								<p>To potentially help monitor and protect the snapping turtle species, an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was performed to determine areas most suitable for their habitat. The 5 criteria considered in this analysis were Aspect, Land Cover, Distance from Waterbody, Distance from Road, and Distance from Fishing Access Points. Data related to these variables were gathered through reliable open sourced hubs. In the StoryMap, users are able to compare the original layers to the site suitability layers, as well as explore the resulting suitability map.</p>
