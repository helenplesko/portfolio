			<h1>Welcome</h1>
			<p>I'm Helen Plesko - born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I'm currently a GIS Applications Specialist student at Fleming College, where I've been creatively using Esri's technologies and other GIS software to interpret aerial photography, prepare and edit geospatial datasets and databases, and create meaningful and interactive cartographic outputs. Continue scrolling or use the navigation buttons below to see the projects I've completed throughout my educational studies at Fleming College thus far.</p>

								<p>To potentially help monitor and protect the snapping turtle species, an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was performed to determine areas most suitable for their habitat. The 5 criteria considered in this analysis were Aspect, Land Cover, Distance from Waterbody, Distance from Road, and Distance from Fishing Access Points. Data related to these variables were gathered through reliable open-sourced hubs. In the StoryMap, users are able to compare the original layers to the site suitability layers, as well as explore the resulting suitability map.</p>
